# What is this? ðŸ¤”
This is a minimum working example of reading and parsing a CSV file in C++. This isn't the best way to do it, but it is one way. This could be improved a lot, just bear that in mind!

## But why?
Two reasons:

1. A short reference solution for UoL students who are stuck with CSV parsing in C++. This is by no means an exemplar solution, and is intended as such -- the burden of expanding this and fixing its issues is on the student who decides to use it.
2. I found out you can connect repl.it to GitHub! Isn't that awesome?

## Can you help me with my assignment?
